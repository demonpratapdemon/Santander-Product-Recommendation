# Santander-Product-Recommendation
Under their current system, a small number of Santanderâ€™s customers receive many recommendations while many others rarely see any resulting in an uneven customer experience. This project is to predict which products their existing customers will use in the next month based on their past behavior and that of similar customers.

Adding the Presentation 1 python notebook to master branch.
